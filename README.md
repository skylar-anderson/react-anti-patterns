This repository is an index of React anti patterns pulled from https://www.perssondennis.com/articles/react-anti-patterns-and-best-practices-dos-and-donts

The purpose of this repository is to experiment with the idea of using semantic code search to test code changes for anti patterns.  Here is the flow:

- an organization manages a repository full of patterns and anti-patterns
- during code review, users can ask copilot to check if a particular line selection is similar to a pattern or anti pattern
- anti patterns are decorated with guidance so that users can undedstand why it's an anti-pattern and how they can avoid them
